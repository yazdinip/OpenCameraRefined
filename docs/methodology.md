# Methodology

## Study design
The program uses a mixed-method approach:
- Controlled usability studies for task completion and errors.
- Bench tests for latency, energy, and image quality.
- Qualitative feedback sessions for perceived accessibility.

## Instrumentation
Instrumentation will capture:
- Interaction events (tap, swipe, voice triggers)
- Timing metrics (time-to-focus, time-to-capture)
- Device telemetry (frame time, thermal state, battery drain)

## Evaluation metrics
Primary metrics:
- Time-to-capture
- Task success rate
- Error recovery time

Secondary metrics:
- Battery impact per session
- Perceived workload (short survey)
- Image quality proxies (blur, exposure stability)

## Analysis plan
- Aggregate metrics per task and user cohort.
- Report confidence intervals and effect sizes.
- Document deviations and anomalies in `experiments/`.
