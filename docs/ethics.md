# Ethics and Participant Safety

## Consent and transparency
Participants receive a clear study brief, consent form, and the option to
withdraw without penalty.

## Privacy and minimization
- No personally identifying data is collected.
- Audio or video capture is disabled unless explicitly required for a study.
- Logs focus on interaction timings and aggregated telemetry.

## Accessibility considerations
- Provide accessible consent materials.
- Offer multiple interaction modalities during studies.
- Ensure device settings support assistive technologies.

## Risk mitigation
- Limit study sessions to avoid fatigue.
- Review instrumentation before each study session.
- Secure storage for any sensitive notes.
