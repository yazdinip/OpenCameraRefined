# Research Aims

## Problem statement
Mobile camera apps expose powerful features but remain hard to access for users
with motor, vision, or cognitive constraints. This project investigates how
interaction design and on-device feedback can improve capture success without
reducing performance.

## Research questions
- R1: Which interaction patterns reduce time-to-capture for accessibility-first
  users?
- R2: What on-device feedback improves capture confidence without increasing
  cognitive load?
- R3: How do accessibility improvements trade off against latency, battery, and
  image quality?

## Planned contributions
- A research-grade Android camera testbed with instrumentation hooks.
- A protocol for evaluating accessible capture tasks in controlled studies.
- A measurement suite for performance and usability trade-offs.

## Scope boundaries
- Not a full reimplementation of camera pipelines.
- No cloud processing; only on-device workflows.
- Data collection focuses on interaction signals and aggregate metrics.
