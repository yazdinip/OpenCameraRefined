# Research Documentation

This folder contains the core documentation for the OpenCameraRefined research
program. It is intended to be updated alongside experiments and releases.

Start here:
- `research-aims.md` research questions and scope
- `methodology.md` study and evaluation plan
- `data-management.md` data handling and retention
- `ethics.md` participant and privacy safeguards
- `reproducibility.md` experiment logging and environment capture
- `experiment-registry.md` how experiments are tracked
- `related-work.md` reading list and grounding

Legacy materials are in `docs/legacy/`.
